Question-1
Answer is 5 because we never updated the score in the variable score.

Question-2
Answer is 60 because balance is first divided by 2, it becomes 50 and then add 10 to it then it becomes 60.

Question-3
Answer is 64 because Line 2 results in an error, because we cannot reassign a value to the const variable. So, age stays 64.
